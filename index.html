   <h2>What is a Bungalow Court?</h2>
    <p>Bungalow courts are a style of multi-family housing that consists of a collection of detached cottages that are positioned in a U-shape around a central landscaped space that faces the street. Their small scale and open configuration creates a living space that feels inherently communal and connected to the surrounding neighborhood. Bungalow courts were popularized in the early 1920s, and are a prominent, but under-appreciated feature of the Berkeley landscape.

    <p> This map is not an exhaustive list of bungalow courts in Berkeley. More of them are tucked into the city, so get out onto the streets of Berkeley and keep your eyes peeled!</p>
